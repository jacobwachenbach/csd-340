        <p class="intro">This is an introduction paragraph about me. I grew up in a small town of 600 people at the time, which had a close-knit community. I really enjoyed how close of a community I had. </p>
        
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is coding. I've been developing software since early highschool, and I find it both challenging and rewarding. My family has been supportive of my passion for technology.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy being outdoors and playing video games. I also love traveling and exploring new places. I am always looking for new experiences that broaden my knowledge.</p>

        <p>I visit often and love to reconnect with old friends. It is a place that will always feel like home to me.</p>
